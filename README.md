# Guards For Me

Use your colonists as patrol guards (follow waypoints and attack threats), bodyguards (follow and protect), standing guards (protect area) and reaction forces (search and kill threats).
Fully customizable.

Guards can kill all wild animals in range ( need to enable the "Exterminate mode" in mod settings ).

Fully customizable.

## FAQ

***How to remove a patrol path ?***

*When you select the patrol waypoint (of the color of the path you want to delete) in the security tab of the architect menu, press the "Del" key to remove it.*

***The work priorities are not applyed and when i enable a guard job all other works are ignored***

*Checks if the setting "Present the function of 'Guard' as a job" is enabled.*

***How to remove the last placed waypoint without having to remove the whole path ?***

*Simply hit the "backspace" key*

***When i affect a colonist to a patrol path he can go on forbidden area***

*To prevent weird behavior ( patrols go forward and backward), when a colonist is affected to a patrol path he ignore his area assignation, to stop that simply unaffect it from his patrol path*

***My colonists dont want to do their guard job (bodyguard, standing guard, patrol guards)***

*Your colonists only work as guard when they are not too wounded (health > 55%), and their needs (food, rest, recreation and mood) is greater than 25% (customizable in settings).
If you enabled the guard duties as job setting, then you need in addition to assign guard colonists to "Guard" job, they will guard based on job priorities you configured.*

***Can i slow down patrolling guards, make them walk instead of run their routes ?***

*Yes in mod settings "Walking mode for patrols" you have the choice between (walk, jog (by default), sprint).*

***When patrol guards reach the end of the path i want them to go back to the first waypoint instead of starting from the opposite direction***

*You can order it in the mod settings "When a guard reaches the end of a patrol", set it to "He goes back to the first waypoint"*

***Weirds behaviors happens (ex : cannot delete waypoints path, ...)***

*Some errors related to other mods can sometime break some harmony patchs, so you should try to put the mod just after HugsLib in your mod list and retry, it can fix this kind of issues.*
